- Prioritize Figma fidelity: match layout, spacing, typography, and states 1:1 with the design.
- Implement all visible states from the design (default/hover/active/disabled/loading) when applicable.
- Use the same component variants as in Figma whenever possible (not “close enough” approximations).
