- IMPORTANT: Always use components from /path_to_your_design_system when possible.
- Do not create new UI primitives if an equivalent component already exists in the design system.
- Avoid hardcoded colors/spacing/typography; use the project’s tokens or theme variables (from Figma tokens when available).
- Prefer consistent typography scale and spacing scale across the app.
- Avoid inline styles unless truly necessary; place reusable UI in /components/ui.
