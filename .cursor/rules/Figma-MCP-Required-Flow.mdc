### Required flow (do not skip)
1. Run get_design_context first for the exact node(s).
2. If response is too large/truncated: run get_metadata, then re-fetch only required node(s) with get_design_context.
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node/variant.
4. Only after get_design_context + get_screenshot: download needed assets and start implementation.
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project’s conventions, tokens, components, and typography.
6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete.
